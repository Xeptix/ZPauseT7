    ZPAUSE T7 v1.5  --  Synced co-op pause for Black Ops III Zombies

    by Xep

======================================================================

    A port of ZPause (Plutonium T6) to Black Ops III. A fork of the T6
    build rather than the older two: T7 has the same button set, the same
    HUD API, the same _hud_util parent bookkeeping and real timer
    elements. What changes is the entry point, the dialect's small print,
    and the freeze -- which this engine does properly.

        Buttons  hold crouch + melee

    Everything runs on the host. Nobody else needs this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    HOW IT WORKS, AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE T6 BUILD

    T6 leans on disablezombies(), the engine-level AI freeze host
    migration uses. Black Ops III has something better and Treyarch uses
    it in zombies already -- the Killing Time GobbleGum, in
    scripts\zm\bgbs\_zm_bgb_killing_time.gsc:

        level flag::set( "world_is_paused" );
        setpauseworld( 1 );

    setpauseworld() is a true world freeze: AI, physics and animation all
    stop, so zombies hold their pose mid-stride rather than standing in an
    idle. zp_freeze_anims has nothing left to do here.

    The flag matters more than the builtin. A large amount of stock
    zombies script already watches it:

        _zm.gsc                   round_spawning blocks on it, so the
                                  spawner stops without touching a gate
        zm_castle_ee_bossfight    boss phase timer waits it out
        zm_siegebot_nikolai       three separate waits
        zm_stalingrad_dragon      skips its think, refuses damage
        zm_stalingrad_zombie      two spawn paths wait
        _zm_ai_napalm             early-out
        _zm_ai_sentinel_drone     waits
        _zm_weap_shrink_ray       early-out

    So a ZPause pause on this engine is deeper than on any of the others:
    boss fights and scripted encounters hold themselves.

    Players have to be exempted from it. setpauseworld() freezes them
    too -- which is why the campaign calls setignorepauseworld( 1 ) on a
    player it wants to keep moving through a paused scene. Here the reason
    is existential: a player who stops being simulated stops reporting
    usebuttonpressed(), and nobody could ever unpause. So players are
    exempted from the world freeze and locked the ordinary way, with
    freezecontrols(). Treyarch pairs the same two calls in campaign.

    Everything else is the T6 build:

        player freezecontrols( 1 )      lock players
        player enableinvulnerability()  nobody can be hurt
        locktimer()                     hold level.discardtime

    locktimer() is byte-for-byte the same function on both engines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOT PORTED

    One setting is inert rather than absent, so that one config works
    across every port: zp_freeze_anims, since the engine freeze already
    stops animation here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    VERIFICATION

    gsc-tool advertises t7 and answers "not implemented" for both
    dialects, so it is no help here. This gets the T5 and T4 treatment
    instead: every call, field, notify, flag and zombie_var checked
    against the stock script dump. See tools/audit.py and
    tools/deep_check.py.

    The t7-compiler is a real compiler, so a bad script is rejected at
    build time rather than on load.

    ENTRY POINT

    Black Ops III registers a script with the system manager and hangs its
    work off the shared callbacks, rather than exposing an init() the
    loader happens to call. system::register runs __init__ once the game
    is up; the callbacks fire per player from there.

    that is the default.

/* ==================================================================
    SETTINGS MENU

    The host changes settings while the game is paused, without a console.
    Only while paused, and not while a vote is open -- the host needs these
    buttons back to vote. The host is held in place while it is open, so
    none of them does anything in the game at the same time.

    Hold fire + melee to open it. Aim and fire move through the list,
    grenade changes the setting, melee closes it.

    Never use. Use is how a player buys, opens and picks up, and World at
    War has no script call that keeps it off a trigger; the same menu on
    every port means none of them reads it. Fire + melee is the one pair of
    what is left that no port offers as a pause combo. With one button to
    change a setting, every change goes forward and wraps: a switch flips,
    a list moves on, a number steps up through a few common values and back
    round to the lowest. Exact values are the console's.

    A change is a setdvar(), the same as typing it into the console, and
    it lands the same way: when play resumes. The pause is built from the
    settings it started with -- the HUD, what is frozen -- and nothing
    rebuilds those in place.

    Its own words go through zp_show() like every other line, so the
    Workshop build draws them in each player's language. The setting names
    and their values stay as the console spells them.

    The rows come from zp_menu_table(), which tools/mk_menu_table.py writes
    from this script's own zp_cfg calls.

    Text costs configstrings (see the HUD notes): every setting name shown
    is one, for the rest of the match. Numbers go through setvalue(), which
    costs none, so the bill is the names and a handful of words -- bounded,
    and paid once. The elements are the host's own, with no parent, so
    there is nothing to take apart if the host drops with it open.
