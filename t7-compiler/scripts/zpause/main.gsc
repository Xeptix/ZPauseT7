    ZPAUSE T7 v1.4  --  Synced co-op pause for Black Ops III Zombies

    by Xep

======================================================================

    A port of ZPause (Plutonium T6) to Black Ops III. A fork of the T6
    build rather than the older two: T7 has the same button set, the same
    HUD API, the same _hud_util parent bookkeeping and real timer
    elements. What changes is the entry point, the dialect's small print,
    and the freeze -- which this engine does properly.

        Buttons  hold crouch + melee

    Everything runs on the host. Nobody else needs this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    HOW IT WORKS, AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE T6 BUILD

    T6 leans on disablezombies(), the engine-level AI freeze host
    migration uses. Black Ops III has something better and Treyarch uses
    it in zombies already -- the Killing Time GobbleGum, in
    scripts\zm\bgbs\_zm_bgb_killing_time.gsc:

        level flag::set( "world_is_paused" );
        setpauseworld( 1 );

    setpauseworld() is a true world freeze: AI, physics and animation all
    stop, so zombies hold their pose mid-stride rather than standing in an
    idle. zp_freeze_anims has nothing left to do here.

    The flag matters more than the builtin. A large amount of stock
    zombies script already watches it:

        _zm.gsc                   round_spawning blocks on it, so the
                                  spawner stops without touching a gate
        zm_castle_ee_bossfight    boss phase timer waits it out
        zm_siegebot_nikolai       three separate waits
        zm_stalingrad_dragon      skips its think, refuses damage
        zm_stalingrad_zombie      two spawn paths wait
        _zm_ai_napalm             early-out
        _zm_ai_sentinel_drone     waits
        _zm_weap_shrink_ray       early-out

    So a ZPause pause on this engine is deeper than on any of the others:
    boss fights and scripted encounters hold themselves.

    Players have to be exempted from it. setpauseworld() freezes them
    too -- which is why the campaign calls setignorepauseworld( 1 ) on a
    player it wants to keep moving through a paused scene. Here the reason
    is existential: a player who stops being simulated stops reporting
    usebuttonpressed(), and nobody could ever unpause. So players are
    exempted from the world freeze and locked the ordinary way, with
    freezecontrols(). Treyarch pairs the same two calls in campaign.

    Everything else is the T6 build:

        player freezecontrols( 1 )      lock players
        player enableinvulnerability()  nobody can be hurt
        locktimer()                     hold level.discardtime

    locktimer() is byte-for-byte the same function on both engines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOT PORTED

    One T6 feature is deliberately not here: the chat commands. Black Ops
    III gives a script no "say" callback to bind to, so there is no
    !pause, and everything is on the button combos -- which is why the
    down-state combos matter as much here as on T5 and T4.

    Two settings are inert rather than absent, so one config works across
    every port: zp_allow_short_words (nothing to shorten without chat) and
    zp_freeze_anims (the engine freeze already stops animation).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    VERIFICATION

    gsc-tool advertises t7 and answers "not implemented" for both
    dialects, so it is no help here. This gets the T5 and T4 treatment
    instead: every call, field, notify, flag and zombie_var checked
    against the stock script dump. See tools/audit.py and
    tools/deep_check.py.

    The t7-compiler is a real compiler, so a bad script is rejected at
    build time rather than on load.

    ENTRY POINT

    Black Ops III registers a script with the system manager and hangs its
    work off the shared callbacks, rather than exposing an init() the
    loader happens to call. system::register runs __init__ once the game
    is up; the callbacks fire per player from there.

    that is the default.
